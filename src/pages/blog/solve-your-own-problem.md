# Solve your own problem, everything else will follow üôå

Think about the products you use every day and the underlying problems they solve.

> Want an easy way to get around town? The problem Uber is solving is your need for access to an on-demand car. Uber happens to be the most efficient way to obtain the on-demand car you‚Äôre looking for; it is the best app on the market to reduce the friction between your problem and a viable solution.

Often times entrepreneurs start out by defining a product before they have identified an actual problem, and yes ‚Äî I‚Äôve been guilty of it too. When this happens you‚Äôll easily start to build a product, find a way to market to it, design an attractive website, only to then discover you can‚Äôt acquire users.

Instead of identifying a solution first, the initial step is to identify the problem. The key here is to be very specific about the problem you are identifying.

> For example, let‚Äôs say the problem you‚Äôve identified is: ‚ÄúI cannot find a fun bar to go to at night in my city.‚Äù Start digging into deeper specifics of the problem.

- Once you‚Äôve identified the problem, the next step is to ideate possible solutions, and they don‚Äôt have to necessarily be technical solutions.
- Then, from those proposed solutions, create prototypes and begin to test each one.
- Continue testing and refining the prototypes until you have enough validation to move full-steam ahead with the one that is working.

_Narrowing down your prototypical solutions through trial and error is incredibly important before advancing forward with your idea._

So before you hatch an idea, first hatch a problem. Define the specific problem that you are attempting to solve and not the idea that you want to build and test ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll end up with a really nice solution and no one to use it.
