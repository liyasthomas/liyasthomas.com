        Hi, my name is Liyas Thomas, I'm a designer, developer, and an
        entrepreneur.
      </p>
      <p>At first I intended to be an artist and started creating art works.</p>
      <p>
        In high school, I was that kid that seemed to never be paying attention.
        Seemingly in my own world of doodles and drawings. I've had a pencil in
        my hand since I was in diapers. Things never change... I'm no longer in
        diapers though.
